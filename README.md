This repo follows through a react router redux [tutorial](http://manojsinghnegi.com/blog/2017/09/03/Implementing-redux-and-react-router-v4-in-your-react-app/)

Tutorial broken into three steps with commit tags:

1. step-one: basic app setup with an <input> field
2. step-two: hook the input to redux
3. step-three: add react-routerV4 with redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
